Look at several Rails/Ruby online API sources and say which one you like best and why.

http://api.rubyonrails.org
http://guides.rubyonrails.org: Seems user-friendly
https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/
http://apionrails.icalialabs.com/book/chapter_one
https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/documentation_tools
https://github.com/rails-api/rails-api
https://www.codementor.io/ruby-on-rails/tutorial/creating-simple-api-with-rails

I'm not sure how to respond to this question, or if I googled the right thing. The ruby-doc.org documentation has been helpful in the course so far, but I can see that I could expand my search into other web content.
