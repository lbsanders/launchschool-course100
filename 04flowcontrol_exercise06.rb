      if x == 4
        puts "yup"
      else
        puts "nope"
    end

    equal_to_four(5)

You get the following error messageâ€¦

Why do you get this error and how can you fix it?

  The error is thrown because the if statement is missing the closing end statement. It can be corrected by adding an end statement below the line "puts 'nope'".
